Preparing Your Cards | All Specs, Tutorials, and Templates

InDesign or Illustrator are your best file-prep options. You might also consider the free layout program, Scribus.

For a host of reasons, we suggest you do not use Microsoft Word. You also shouldn't use Photoshop on its own. (When used in tandem with InDesign, Photoshop will help yield quality results. When used alone, text oftentimes will not print as clearly as desired and it will not export PDFs to spec.)
